# Kelsey Chua - Convergence Concepts Front End Exercise

Requirements: Create a simple web app that accomplishes the following:

- When the app starts, fetch /photos JSON data from the http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com website

- Create a horizontally scrollable list of photos that represent the data you fetched. Each photo should have the “title” text written diagonally across the photo, have rounded corners, a border, and should have a drop shadow.  This should scroll smoothly.

- The photos that are downloaded must be cached so that if the app is terminated, the next session should not have to download previously downloaded images again.

- Add a button to the screen below the scrollable photo list. Tapping this button will reorder the list in completely random order. Use a recursive function to reorder the list.
